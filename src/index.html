      Seasoned explorers, vehemently insisting on what they had seen,
      set down mountains and islands on their charts where there was
      nothing but empty sky ... Expeditions sent out later to verify
      these new lands sometimes saw the same fata morgana, further
      confusing the issue. Only by prolonging their arduous journeys,
      thereby observing a constant receding of the image, did they
      prove that the land was not there at all.
